# Wanda Question

Wanda Question is a new way of communicating with the end user in Unit4 ERP.
Wanda Question is available as an action type in Extension Kit.

This example is a simple showcase on how you could ask the end user a question, and act on the true/false response.
The example contains of a Postman collection who kicks off the Webhook-trigger in Extension Kit, and the flow itself.

Below you can see an example of the dialogue between the end user and Wanda in Teams.

# Actual usecase 

Tellit Solutions has developed an standard integration with ELMA (Peppol SMP) where we communicate with the end user through Wanda Questions if there is a need to update the customer register.
If the end user gives a positive response, we update the customer using the Customer REST API.
