# Use Templating script (Liquid) to create a POST to a SOAP Webservice

This example shows how you can use liquid script (Action type = Templating script) in Extension Kit to build a POST-request dynamically.
Click on the file "Build POST method" to view the example script.

# How to use the examples

The example script only shows how you can use the "capture function" to dynamically build a POST.
This is not a working/complete example, but you can use this concept to build your own scripts.
You can use the output of this Liquid script (a step in Extension Kit flow) in a subsequent HTTP-action to call the SOAP API.
