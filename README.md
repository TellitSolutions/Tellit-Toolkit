# Tellit Toolkit

Tellit Toolkit contains examples, how-to guides, and fully working samples for Unit4 Extension Kit flows and examples on how to use Unit4 REST APIs.
Tellit Solutions has decided to share some of our knowledge to inspire customers to start using the latest technology from Unit4.
Some code examples are meant to showcase certain features in Extension Kit and Wanda, while others are more examples on how to solve a certain task.

If you need some advise and support on how to use the latest tools from Unit4, you are more than welcome to contact us in Tellit Solutions.

# Tellit Integration Hub

Integrations are becoming an increasingly important part of our customers' system landscape and with the launch of Tellit Integration Hub we can offer modern and scalable integrations. Tellit Integration Hub is based on Azure Data Factory, which is a cloud-based, serverless platform where we offer integrations as a service (IaaS), based on microservices.

The advantage is that we can develop modern integrations independently of the ERP provider's integration platform, and help our customers reduce their technical debt. By using APIs, we can develop integrations where you can easily replace individual components you replace parts of their 3rd party systems.


# Unit4 Extension Kit

As part of the Unit4 People Platform, the Unit4 Extensions Kit delivers low/no-code automation as a Service, extending capabilities of the Unit4 People Experience Platform.
Each Extension Flow consists of a trigger, one or multiple actions and a set of conditions. Extension Kit listens to the trigger and then automatically runs the actions if the conditions are met!

Tellit Solutions is determined to be market leaders in Extension Kit, and to deliver innovate solutions to customers running Unit4 ERP worldwide.
Tellit Solutions was the first Unit4 partner globally to deliver an App developed in Extension Kit for the Unit4 Marketplace. 
This App was showcased by Unit4 at a partner event in Boston in 2022. By the launch of Unit4 Marketplace in January 2023, Tellit Solutions had 6 Apps ready, more than any other Unit4 partners combined.

# Wanda - The digital assistant
