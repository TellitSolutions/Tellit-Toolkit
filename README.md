# Unit4 Extension Kit

As part of the Unit4 People Platform, the Unit4 Extensions Kit delivers low/no-code automation as a Service, extending capabilities of the Unit4 People Experience Platform.
Each Extension Flow consists of a trigger, one or multiple actions and a set of conditions. Extension Kit listens to the trigger and then automatically runs the actions if the conditions are met!

Tellit Solutions is determined to be market leaders in Extension Kit, and to deliver innovate solutions to customers running Unit4 ERP worldwide.
Tellit Solutions was the first Unit4 partner globally to deliver an App developed in Extension Kit for the upcoming Unit4 Marketplace. 
Our App was showcased at the partner event in Boston.

# Wanda - The digital assistant

Tellit Solutions was the first Unit4 partner globally to deliver an App for the Unit4 Marketplace that involved having a dialogue with the end-user using Wanda.

# Unit4 REST APIs

All REST APIs in Unit4 is documented in Swagger UI in something called a webapi-server. The URL to your webapi-server can be obtained from your system administrator.
Typically the Swagger UI definition looks similar to the example below:

Unit4s REST APIs are using ODATA syntax to retrieve data.
