# Howto's for Unit4 REST APIs

This folder contains examples on how to use the Unit4 REST APIs.
We have choosen to share the examples as JSON-files that you could import into PostMan, and run them directly in your customer environement.
NB: You will need to change the URL of the examples to your customer specific URL for the webapi-server. You also need to have an ERP user with access to the APIs.
