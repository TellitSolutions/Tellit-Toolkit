# Postman examples

This folder contains collections of Postman examples on how to test the Unit4 REST APIs. 
Currently the examples cover how to use the most common REST APIs, like Customer, Supplier, Employee and General Ledger.
Each collection usually contains examples on how to retrieve, update and insert data.

More examples will be added once we have some useful examples to share.

You can import these JSON collections into your own Postman profile, and continue working with them.
