# Tellit Integration Hub

Integrations are becoming an increasingly important part of our customers' system landscape and with the launch of Tellit Integration Hub we can offer modern and scalable integrations. Tellit Integration Hub is based on Azure Data Factory, which is a cloud-based, serverless platform where we offer integrations as a service (IaaS), based on microservices.

# What is Tellit Integration Hub?

Modern and scalable integrations in the cloud, allowing you to:

- Offer Integration as a Service
- Reduce technical debt
- Develop integrations for tomorrow
- Pay as you go (No need to invest in an integration platform)
- Develop integrations based on microservices
- Reuse more of your existing integrations, if you replace your 3rd party systems
- Connect to almost any datasource or API
- Become less dependent or your ERP-platform or ERP-supplier
- More easily hire competence/consultants as .Net and Azure knowledge is system independent


# The advantages of Tellit Integration Hub

The advantage is that we can develop modern integrations independently of the ERP provider's integration platform, and help our customers reduce their technical debt. By using APIs, we can develop integrations where you can easily replace individual components you replace parts of their 3rd party systems.

Customers don't need to invest in their own integration platform, as integrations are running in Azure in the cloud, meaning you only pay for computing power.

Another advantage is that Tellit Integration Hub can connect to almost any type of API.
While Extension Kit is limited to do integrations using WebServices/APIs and file transfer through SFTP, you can also develop database integrations in Tellit Integration Hub. Unlike Extension Kit, you can write .Net/C# code which give you full flexibility and control and run your code as an Azure Function.
This allows for more complex scenarioes and reusable code as your Azure Function could be called from anywhere.

# When to use which tool?

Tellit Solutions is one of Unit4 partners globally with the most experience in using Extension Kit from Unit4s People Platform.
We had 6 apps ready for the launch of Unit4 Marketplace in January 2023, which is a testament to our investments and competence on Extension Kit.
In addition we offer training on Extension Kit for customers and partners globally.

Our experience with Extension Kit is that it is an efficient platform to build relatively low complex integrations. It has some limitations as you cannot develop database integrations and we have not been able to develop integrations that require high security with the use of some special X509-certificates for authentication. Another weakness with the current version of Extension Kit is that it doesn't support any option for doing re-runs when a flow fails.

One advantage of Extension Kit is the Message Hub events allow you to respond to events in Unit4 ERP in "real-time".

However, Extension Kit is not available to all customers of Unit4 ERP so we had to look elsewhere to be able to offer a modern integration platform which we could help on-prem customers of Unit4 ERP on their Cloud-journey. The result was Tellit Integration Hub which allow us to develop integrations and automation solutions in one single platform, that can be made available to both on-prem, Partner Cloud and Unit4 Cloud customers.

Tellit Integration Hub provides full flexibility as it supports all kinds of APIs, it has a flexible pricing model as you pay for usage, and you can write .Net/C# code which is familiar from over a decade of writing code in Agresso Customization Tool (ACT). The added flexibility of writing .Net/C# code gives endless possibilities, but that also has a cost. Yes, you can solve any problem known to man, but the added flexibility could also mean that the cost of development increase. It all depends on the usecase really.

The biggest advantage of Tellit Integration Hub is that it is independent of your ERP system. This mean you can develop integrations, where a lot of the functionality could be reused if you down the road would change ERP-system. As it is based on Azure Data Factory it also mean that sourcing consultants to develop integrations is easier.

To summarize, Extension Kit is an excellent tool to develop low complex / non-critical integrations. However, it is not accessible to all customers of Unit4 ERP.
Tellit Integration Hub allows for more flexibility and a way to develop more complex integrations in a low-code environment. But, the more complexity you add, you also add costs.

Tellit Solutions have choosen to use Tellit Integration Hub both in integrations for our internal development of our own ISV-solutions, and for customers looking for a platform that are modern, low-code, scalable and that can help them on their cloud-journey.
