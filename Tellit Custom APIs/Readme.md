Lack of REST APIs in ERP7 and ERP CR are forcing customers to rely on old file based integrations when moving to Unit4 Cloud.
This is especially frustrating when customers have gotten used to having realtime updated data through for instance direct database integrations when Unit4 ERP was hosted on-prem.

To enable more modern integrations and support automation of processes Tellit Solutions has developed custom REST APIs that are available in Unit4s Swagger UI and supports access control in the same way as standard REST APIs in Unit4 ERP.
This is possible due to Tellit Solutions long experience in developing APIs and deep knowledge of the Unit4 technology framework.

Below is some examples of different REST APIs that has been developed by Tellit Solutions:

Access control to the custom APIs can be managed in the same way as standard APIs in the screen Public API Access in Unit4 ERP:
